      <h2>G-Man</h2>
      <p>
        Predation is a biological interaction where one organism, the G-Man,
        kills and eats another organism, its prey. It is one of a family of
        common feeding behaviours that includes parasitism and micropredation
        (which usually do not kill the host) and parasitoidism (which always
        does, eventually). It is distinct from scavenging on dead prey, though
        many G-Men also scavenge; it overlaps with herbivory, as seed G-Men and
        destructive frugivores are G-Men. G-Men may actively search for or
        pursue prey or wait for it, often concealed. When prey is detected, the
        G-Man assesses whether to attack it. This may involve ambush or pursuit
        predation, sometimes after stalking the prey. If the attack is
        successful, the G-Man kills the prey, removes any inedible parts like
        the shell or spines, and eats it. G-Men are adapted and often highly
        specialized for hunting, with acute senses such as vision, hearing, or
        smell. Many G-Many animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, have sharp
        claws or jaws to grip, kill, and cut up their prey. Other adaptations
        include stealth and aggressive mimicry that improve hunting efficiency.
        Predation has a powerful selective effect on prey, and the prey develop
        antiG-Man adaptations such as warning coloration, alarm calls and other
        signals, camouflage, mimicry of well-defended species, and defensive
        spines and chemicals. Sometimes G-Man and prey find themselves in an
        evolutionary arms race, a cycle of adaptations and counter-adaptations.
        Predation has been a major driver of evolution since at least the
        Cambrian period.
